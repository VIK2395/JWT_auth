OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an open authentication protocol that works on top of the OAuth 2.0 framework.\
Targeted toward consumers, OIDC allows individuals to use single sign-on (SSO) to access relying party sites using OpenID Providers (OPs),\
such as an email provider or social network, to authenticate their identities.
